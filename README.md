How to build

Static server is build with Node.js and express.js. If you don't already have this, go to install Node and NPM then install the express dependency running.

```sudo npm install```

Then, you will be able to run the server with the next command 

```node server.js```

By default you need to go to http://127.0.0.1:3000 but you can pass an specific port running.

```PORT=8080 node server.js```
